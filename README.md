<p align="center">This project was inspired by the well-known and hated Photoshop.<br>
And no offense, but Adobe sucks.<br>
That's the reason why this POS exists. <br>
Okay, Jokes aside this project exists, because currently I'm studying CNNs, which use convolution operation.<br>
I learned more about various kernels and decided, why not to play around with them and many others. That's the purpose of this project, not desires of changing the world or anything, but to practice coding of convolution methods!</p>
<h4>Hope You Enjoy!</h4>
